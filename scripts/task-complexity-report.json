      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and Environment",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup task into specific subtasks covering repository initialization, dependency installation, configuration of core libraries (Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Shadcn UI, Zustand), folder structure setup, and deployment configuration.",
      "reasoning": "This is a standard project setup task with moderate complexity. The technologies are well-documented and commonly used together. The task is well-defined with clear steps, but requires careful configuration to ensure all components work together properly."

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Figma API Integration",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Create detailed subtasks for the Figma API integration, including serverless function development, authentication handling, URL parsing, data fetching with proper error handling, and implementing caching and rate limiting mechanisms.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves external API integration with security considerations. Working with the Figma API requires understanding its authentication model, rate limits, and data structures. The proxy serverless function adds complexity, as does implementing proper caching and error handling."

      "taskTitle": "Develop Node Detection and Processing System",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the node detection system into subtasks covering data model creation, TEXT node processing, IMAGE node processing, position data extraction, style parsing, and transformation to the application's internal format with proper error handling.",
      "reasoning": "This is a core system component with high complexity. It requires deep understanding of Figma's node structure and the ability to transform this data into a usable internal format. Handling different node types and nested structures adds significant complexity."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Create Visual Preview System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the visual preview system into subtasks for creating the base preview component, implementing position-accurate layout, applying text and image styling, ensuring responsive behavior, and optimizing rendering performance.",
      "reasoning": "Creating a visual system that accurately represents Figma designs is challenging. It requires precise positioning, proper styling application, and performance optimization. The system must handle various node types while maintaining visual fidelity across different screen sizes."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Slot Management System",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for the slot management system covering JSON slot definition, selection mechanism, form interface development, real-time preview updates, and style preservation during content changes.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating an interactive editing system with real-time updates. The complexity comes from maintaining visual consistency while allowing content changes, and ensuring the form interface properly connects to the preview system."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Template Storage and Sharing",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the template storage system into subtasks for database schema design, save functionality implementation, unique ID generation, API endpoint creation, and URL generation with appropriate access controls.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires backend development with database integration. The complexity involves designing a proper storage system, implementing secure access controls, and ensuring reliable template retrieval and sharing."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Build Export Functionality",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the export functionality into subtasks for HTML-to-canvas rendering, PNG generation with quality control, download mechanism implementation, JSON data export, and progress indication with error handling.",
      "reasoning": "Export functionality involves complex browser rendering capabilities and handling potentially large files. Converting HTML to high-quality images presents technical challenges, especially with performance considerations and error handling for large templates."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Advanced Node Support",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for advanced node support covering complex text styling, group and frame handling, nested component support, advanced image processing, shape rendering with image fills, and fallback strategies for complex layouts.",
      "reasoning": "This is the most technically complex task, requiring deep understanding of Figma's advanced features and how to render them accurately. Supporting complex styling, nested structures, and various fill types significantly increases the implementation difficulty."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Create Separate Editor and Public Interfaces",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the interface creation task into subtasks for editor interface implementation, public generator interface development, domain separation configuration, and ensuring consistent user experience with appropriate security policies.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating two distinct but related interfaces. The complexity is moderate, focusing on proper separation of concerns while maintaining a consistent user experience across both interfaces."
